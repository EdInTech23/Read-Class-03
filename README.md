### 1. What is the BIOS
BIOS is a firmware and the first program to run when a computer is turned on. The BIOS gets everything on the computer ready to work so that the os can be started . First the BIOS runs POST. Then it tells the computer where to look for the OS.

POST is a checking process . It checks if all the hardware is there or in working order . Once it has confirmed that everything is good to go, the OS loads up.
### 4. What is CMOS?
The CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor ) is a small storage device attached to your motherboard that keeps track of date and time including some hardware settings. It's the physical location where the BIOS stores its contents.
### 5. What is the CMOS battery?
The CMOS battery is a small battery that is plugged into the motherboard . It keeps the CMOS with power even when the computer is off. If the battery is taken out you will lose your bios setting and it will reset  you time and date .
